(This setup file is for building on mac, I've run it and committed the changes)

* This is a custom unity webview fork to allow pausing and resuming unity while the WebView is running. (Notice: some of the impelementation is in webviewObject.cs)
* Setup
		
	Goto plugins\Android and open install.sh
	Update "UNITY" with your unity version path (i.e. UNITY="/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.30f1") This batch sets up the android project (copies files into src)
	
	Update classes.jar with the webview/libs folder with the relevant unity classes (i.e. "${UNITY}/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/Variations/${SCRIPTING_BACKEND}/${MODE}/Classes/classes.jar")
	
	NOTE: local.properties needs to be configured w/ path to Android SDK used by Unity (i.e. sdk.dir=/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2020.3.30f1/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/SDK)


####
After Building the project with install.sh copy the WebViewPlugin.aar from dest directory into the relevant path in dist directory.
